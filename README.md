I did have more but deleted them months ago and can't get them back. Also about the terrible tic tac toe win check at the time of writing it (and all the others) I was still in hs and didn't know 2d arrays
I'll update some parts of these if I learn or find new code that could be used but I won't be fixing the checkwin, for example the clear screen in Nadelio's [sotf](https://github.com/Nadelio/SOTF/blob/main/GAMEFILES/clear_screen.py)
